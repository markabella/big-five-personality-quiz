# big-five-personality-quiz

Bulk of code for Big Five Personality Quiz was cloned from Alexa's Trivia Skill.

Instead of having a “right” answer, I set each questions answers from 1 to 5. 1 for agree, 2 for slightly agree, 3 for neutral, 4 for slightly disagree, and 5 for disagree.

Since there were no wrong answers and the diagnostic needed an answer for each question to be accurate, I looped the same question over and over until the user gave an answer between the number one and five. The Trivia Skill just responded with “wrong answer” if a user did not respond with an appropriate answer.

All of the user’s answers are stored in an array for the program to sum at the end to determine a user’s big five personality traits.

Luckily the 50 question Big Five personality quiz is public domain as well as well as the diagnostic used for evaluation.

Enjoy
